# linkedin-job-success-analysis
The objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing the success rate of employers in finding suitable candidates for their job postings on LinkedIn. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the project will develop models that provide detailed insights into the components driving this process. This will help employers make informed decisions on how to refine their job descriptions and implement changes to attract better-qualified applicants or increase the overall number of applications.
